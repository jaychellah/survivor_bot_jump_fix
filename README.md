# [L4D/2] Survivor Bot Jump Fix
A simple SourceMod plugin which addresses the issue where survivor bots oftentimes won't jump on certain ledges and props.

# Optional
- Use [this extension](https://github.com/jchellah/survivor_bot_blockers_fix) alongside this plugin, if you also want bots to be able to jump on **env_physics_blocker**s and **env_player_blocker**s. You may need to use these entities since some clip brushes aren't good enough to make a climbable ledge for bots!

# Requirements
- [SourceMod 1.11.6820+](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=dev) (or [DHooks 2.2.0](https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2), but not recommended)

# Supported Platforms
- Linux
- Windows
